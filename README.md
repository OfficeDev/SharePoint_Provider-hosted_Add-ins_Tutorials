# A Series of Visual Studio Solutions to Accompany the MSDN Tutorial Series about Provider-hosted Add-ins #

> SharePoint add-in model is considered as a legacy option for extending SharePoint user interface. Please see [SharePoint Framework documentation](https://aka.ms/spfx) and the [SharePoint Framework samples](https://aka.ms/spfx-webparts) for the future proven option to extend SharePoint Online. Possible backend services should be using Azure Active Directly based registration and related app models.

This repository is a series of *provider-hosted* SharePoint Add-in samples that are used with the tutorial series that begins with [Get started creating provider-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/fp142381.aspx).

None of the samples in this repository contain *Sharepoint-hosted* SharePoint Add-ins. For information about the differences between the two types of SharePoint Add-ins, see [SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp179930.aspx). 

### Applies to ###
-  SharePoint Online and on-premise SharePoint 2013 and later 

### Prerequisites ###
We recommend that you read the MSDN article [SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp179930.aspx).

# Overview #
This set of samples tracts the series of tutorials that begin at [Get started creating provider-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/fp142381.aspx). Each tutorial adds to the sample SharePoint add-in, **Chain Store**. This series of samples preserves the state of the add-in's Visual Studio solution after each tutorial. Before beginning any tutorial, you can open the corresponding sample solution in Visual Studio and follow along. For example, to follow the tutorial [Give the add-in the SharePoint look-and-feel](), open the BeforeSharePointUI.sln file in Visual Studio. 

The following are the tutorial articles and the corresponding sample solutions:

- [Get started creating provider-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/fp142381.aspx): N/A

# To use these samples #

12. Open **Visual Studio** as an administrator.
13. Open the .sln file for the solution you need.
13. In **Solution Explorer**, highlight the SharePoint add-in project and replace the **Site URL** property with the URL of your SharePoint developer site.
14. If your test SharePoint developer site is an on premises SharePoint 2013, open the AppManifest.xml file and change the SharePointMinVersion value to "15.0.0.0".
15. The samples assume that Visual Studio is using Version 12 (SQL 2014) of SQL Express. If you have SQL Server 2016 installed on your development computer, you need to make a change to the web.config file in the solution. Find the line that sets the **SqlAzureConnectionString** near the top of the file. Change the phrase "ProjectsV12" in the value to "ProjectsV13". You will need to do this for each of the solutions in the repo.
15. Follow the instructions in the corresponding tutorial to add functionality to the add-in and test it.

# Known issues

If you get a **System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException** after pressing F5 to start one of the solutions, this may be caused by having a more recent version of SQL Server installed on your development computer. For the fix, see the section above **To use these samples**.
